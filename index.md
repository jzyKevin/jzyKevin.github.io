## About Me

#### üëã Hi there! I'm **Zhouyang Jin**

I'm a second-year Ph.D. student at the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. My research interests are primarily focused on **large language models (LLMs)**, with a particular emphasis on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **recommendation systems**, **graph  network analysis**, and **natural language processing (NLP)**. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Information and Computational Science from the School of Mathematics at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

üî≠ Current Work

Currently, I am exploring the integration of LLMs with various domains and methods to enhance the capabilities of LLMs, including RAG.

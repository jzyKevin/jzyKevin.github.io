## About Me

#### üëã Hi there! I'm **Zhouyang Jin**

I'm a second-year Ph.D. student at the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. My research interests are primarily focused on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, with a particular emphasis on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **Information Retrieval**, **Graph Network Analysis**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Information and Computational Science from the School of Mathematics at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

### üî≠ Current Work

Currently, I am investigating the **integration of LLMs with diverse domains and techniques** to not only enhance the capabilities of LLMs, such as RAG, but also to leverage their potential in addressing challenges within other fields. This approach aims to refine domain-specific models and foster mutual advancement between LLMs and these specialized areas.

###  Research Interests

- **Large Language Models:** Embeddings, Machine Reading Comprehension, Fine-tuning Strategies
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Information Retrieval & Language Models, End-to-end RAG Models, the Evaluation of RAG, and Cross-domain RAG
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Information Extraction, Text Generation, Semantic Embedding, Knowledge Discovery
- **Graph Network Analysis:** Graph Compression, Graph Isomorphism
- **...**
